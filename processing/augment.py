    Using `DropChunk` as an augmentation strategy helps a models.encoder.learn to rely
    on all parts of the signal, since it can't expect a given part to be
    present.
    Arguments
    ---------
    drop_length_low : int
        The low end of lengths for which to set the
        signal to zero, in samples.
    drop_length_high : int
        The high end of lengths for which to set the
        signal to zero, in samples.
    drop_count_low : int
        The low end of number of times that the signal
        can be dropped to zero.
    drop_count_high : int
        The high end of number of times that the signal
        can be dropped to zero.
    drop_start : int
        The first index for which dropping will be allowed.
    drop_end : int
        The last index for which dropping will be allowed.
    drop_prob : float
        The probability that the batch of signals will
        have a portion dropped. By default, every batch
        has portions dropped.
    noise_factor : float
        The factor relative to average amplitude of an utterance
        to use for scaling the white noise inserted. 1 keeps
        the average amplitude the same, while 0 inserts all 0's.
    waveforms : ndarray
        Shape should be `[batch, time]` or `[batch, time, channels]`.
    lengths : ndarray
        Shape should be a single dimension, `[batch]`.
    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of shape `[batch, time]` or
        `[batch, time, channels]`
